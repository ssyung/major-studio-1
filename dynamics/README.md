# Renewable Energy and Good Governance in Africa

This project was created as part M.S. Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design at The New School. In partnership with UNDP's Regional Bureau Africa office, students developed visualizations to accompany the publication [Transforming lives through
renewable energy access in Africa: UNDPâ€™s Contributions] (http://www.africa.undp.org/content/dam/rba/docs/Issue%20Briefs/Africa_Renewable_Energy_v8_web.pdf)

Renewable Energy and Good Governance seeks to view renewable energy in Africa through the lens of [SDG 16:] (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16) Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels

Accountable institutions and good governance are necessary prerequisites for building sustainable renewable energy infrastructure. History has shown how natural resources wealth, a promising means of building national economies and benefiting public good, are instead corruptly diverted by a select few in positions of power.

Africa's vast renewable energy potential holds many possibilities for helping countries realize the sustainable development goals, however, the successful implementation of renewable energy projects rests on the stability and support of local governing bodies.

By transposing [World Governance Indicators] (http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#home), which aggregate country indicators on six dimensions of governance: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, Control of Corruption and data on renewable energy potential and capacity, pattern pairs are revealed.
